# AR-traffic-model

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the traffic model presented in the following publication:

P. Schulz, A. Tra√ül, N. Schwarzenberg, and G. Fettweis: "Analysis and Modeling of Downlink Traffic in Cloud-Rendering Architectures for Augmented Reality",
to be submitted to IEEE 5G World Forum 2021, Montreal, Canada.

## Overview of the Files
A more detailed description may be found in the files.

### Main functions
Filename | Description
